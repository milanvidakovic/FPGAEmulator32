# 32-bit-CPU-emulator
Emulates 32-bit custom CPU machine language instructions.
Provides disassembler functionality with basic debugging (breakpoints, step, run, stop, watch and change registers, watch and change memory).

If you click on each register (or flag) on the top of the main window, you will be able to enter a new value for it.

If you double click, or click&F2 on a cell in the Memory or Memory write window, you will be able to change the memory cell value.
